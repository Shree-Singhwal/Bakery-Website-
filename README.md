## Folder Structure

For this website to work correctly, please maintain the folder structure as shown below:

project/
├── index.html

│ ├── css/
│ │ └── style.css
│ ├── js/
│ │ └── script.js
│ └── image/
│ ├── logo.jpg
│ ├── home-image.jpg
│ └── [... all other images]


If you're uploading or downloading files individually via GitHub, recreate this folder structure manually, or links to CSS, JS, and images will break.

## What I Learned

When I started this project, I only knew basic HTML and how to set a font-family in CSS.
Before starting this project, I was only familiar with basic font-family usage and fundamental CSS. While building this project, I had to learn and implement many new concepts in CSS and JavaScript, which greatly improved the website’s quality and interactivity.

To build this website, I had to learn and apply many new concepts, including:

1. **Built fully responsive layouts** using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox, allowing content to adjust smoothly across screen sizes.

2. **Mastered media queries** to adapt design and layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

3. **Added dynamic interactivity** by toggling classes with JavaScript — enabling elements like the navbar, search bar, and cart to behave like real app components.

4. **Simulated dropdown-like behavior** for the cart and search sections to create a smooth, intuitive user experience.

5. **Organized and scaled CSS** efficiently using :root variables and reusable utility classes.

6. **Designed hover effects** across nearly all interactive elements — including buttons, icons, links, and product cards — to enhance engagement and feedback.

7. **Integrated a real-world map** into the contact section to provide location-based context, making the layout feel authentic and practical.


This project helped me go far beyond the basics and build a visually pleasing and functional frontend from scratch.
